public class HelloWorld {

//        window.console.log()

        System.out.print("Hello world!!"); //prints the line
        System.out.println("Hello world!!");//prints out the line
        System.out.printf("\nHello %s, today is %s, and its the %dth day of the week", "Codeup", "Friday", 5);
                          // \n gives you new line
        //when you run the command the result is....
        //HellosCodeup, today is Friday, and its the 5th day of the week
        //Process finished with exit code 0

    }
}

// or you can use psvm instead of writing out the whole command of public static void main and you can
//also use sout instead of writing out System.out.print
